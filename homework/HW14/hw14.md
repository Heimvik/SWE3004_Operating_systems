# Homework: Linux memory management

## Question 1
Made this function right here.
```C
void q1(){
    int *i = NULL;
    int j = *i;
}
```
The printout is as follows:
```bash
➜  HW14 git:(master) ✗ ./hw14 
[1]    5521 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./hw14
```
When running this program, I get a segmentation fault. This is because I am trying to dereference a null pointer, which accesses a memory location that is not allocated to my process yet.

## Question 2
I compiled the program with the -g flag, and then ran it in gdb. The printout is as follows:
```C
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x000055555555513d in q1 () at hw14.c:8
8	    int j = *i;
(gdb) 
```
Always amazes me how useful gdb is. It shows me the line where the segmentation fault happened, and I can see that it was in the function q1, which is correct.

## Question 3
I once again compiled the program with the -g, but also the -O0, flag not not allow for any compiler optimizations, as my program is not the most functional one. I then ran it in valgrind. The printout is as follows:
```bash
➜  HW14 git:(master) ✗ valgrind --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=low ./hw14 
==7575== Memcheck, a memory error detector
==7575== Copyright (C) 2002-2022, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.

==7575==  If you believe this happened as a result of a stack
==7575==  overflow in your program's main thread (unlikely but
==7575==  possible), you can try to increase the size of the
==7575==  main thread stack using the --main-stacksize= flag.
==7575==  The main thread stack size used in this run was 8388608.

```
The output shows that I am trying to read from a memory location that is not allocated to my process, but also where invalid memory read is happening. It also shows that there are no memory leaks, which is expected as I am not dynamically allocating any memory in this program. Such a useful tool.

## Question 4
I made this fucntion to perform the asked funcitonality:
```C
void q4(){
    int *i = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
}
```
The printout is as follows:
```bash
  HW14 git:(master) ✗ valgrind --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high ./hw14

```
What i do in the program is that i malloc an int (4 bytes of memory), but do not free it before exiting, and as the pointer is allocated on the stack, the referenced dynamically allocated integer becomes lost forever. This is what valgrind is showing me, and it is correct. I can also see that the memory is allocated in the function q4, and no other memory leaks in the program is present.

## Question 5
I made this function to perform the asked functionality:
```C
void q5(){
    int* data = (int*)malloc(100*sizeof(int));
    data[100] = 0;
    free(data);
}
```
The printout is as follows:
```bash
➜  HW14 git:(master) ✗ valgrind --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high ./hw14

==8921== 
==8921== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==8921== ERROR SUMMARY: 1 errors from 1 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```
The output shows that I am trying to write to a memory location that is invalid, that is its not allocated to my process. It also shows that there are no memory leaks, which is expected as I am freeing the data before exiting.

## Question 6
I made this function to perform the asked functionality:
```C
void q6() {
    int* data = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    free(data);
    printf("%d\n", data[0]);
}
```
When running it without valgrind, the printout is as follows:
```bash
➜  HW14 git:(master) ✗ ./hw14                                                  
Accessing freed memory: 5
```
With valgrind, the printout is as follows:
```bash
➜  HW14 git:(master) ✗ valgrind --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high ./hw14
==9172== Memcheck, a memory error detector
==9172== Copyright (C) 2002-2022, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.

```
The output in valgrind shows that I accessing freed memory, but also the location I access the freed element as well as the index in the array im accessing incorrectly.

## Question 7
I then tried to give the free funciton a funny value, which was done as follows where the rest of the code is q6():
```C
    free(data+5);

```
Already when compiling the printout is:
```bash
➜  HW14 git:(master) ✗ gcc -O0 -o hw14 -g hw14.c

free(): invalid pointer

```
With valgrind the printout is as follows:

```
The output shows that I am trying to free a pointer that is not the start of the allocated memory, and that I am trying to access uninitialized memory. Valgrind detects it (of course), but so does the compiler. Could be an idea to use the -Werror flag to make sure that all warnings are treated as errors, which would also pick up the error in this case.

## Question 8
For the vector-like data structure, a simple implementation of a fifo buffer with a init, push and pop function was made. The fifo also has a free interface, and it lookes like this:
```C
typedef struct {
    int *array;
    size_t size;
    size_t capacity;
} fifo_t;

void initFifo(fifo_t *vec) {
    vec->array = NULL;
    vec->size = 0;
    vec->capacity = 0;
}

void psuhFifo(fifo_t *vec, int value) {
    if (vec->size == vec->capacity) {
        vec->capacity = (vec->capacity == 0) ? 1 : vec->capacity * 2;
        vec->array = (int *)realloc(vec->array, vec->capacity * sizeof(int));
    }
    vec->array[vec->size++] = value;
}

int popFifo(fifo_t *vec) {
    int value = vec->array[0];
    for (size_t i = 1; i < vec->size; i++) {
        vec->array[i - 1] = vec->array[i];
    }
    vec->size--;
    return value;
}

void freeFifo(fifo_t *vec) {
    free(vec->array);
    vec->array = NULL;
    vec->size = 0;
    vec->capacity = 0;
}
```
This funciton test the funcitonality and performance of the fifo:
```C
void q8() {
    fifo_t vec;
    initFifo(&vec);

    const int num_elements = 1000000;
    clock_t start, end;

    start = clock();
    for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
        psuhFifo(&vec, i);

    }
    end = clock();
    printf("Time to push %d elements: %f seconds\n", num_elements, (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC);

    start = clock();
    for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
        popFifo(&vec);
    }
    end = clock();
    printf("Time to pop %d elements: %f seconds\n", num_elements, (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC);

    freeFifo(&vec);
}
```
The printout is as follows:
```bash
➜  HW14 git:(master) ✗ ./hw14                           
Time to push 10000 elements: 0.000180 seconds
Time to pop 10000 elements: 0.155877 seconds
```
Notice the difference in pushing an popping times, which is expected as the pop function has to shift all the elements in the array down one index, which is O(n) in time complexity (I know, two circular pointers is a way better implementaiton). The push function is O(1) in time complexity, as it only has to reallocate the array if it is full. I also tried to run it with valgrind, but this time i also utilized the tool massif, which visualizes the memory usage as a graph in a seperate file (massif.out by deafult). Printing this file by
```bash
ms_print massif.out
```
will give a printout of the memory usage over time. I ran the program with 1000000 elements, and the printout is as follows::
```bash

The printout isn't particularly interesting in this case, but it shows the memory usage over time. The first part of the printout shows the memory usage over time, and the second part shows the memory usage at each snapshot. The last part shows the memory usage at the end of the program.

## Question 9
Some time were spent reading the manual pages for gdb and valgrind, and I have to say that they are both very useful tools. I have used both tools extensively before, but always nice to refresh a little bit. Especially valgrind is useful for bare-metal microcontroller programming, where the effects of no OS and careful stack management is very important.
